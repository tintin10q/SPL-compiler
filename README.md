## Setting up a development environment

If you are using Visual Studio Code, setting up a development environment is very easy.

1. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers);
1. Open this project using Visual Studio Code;
1. Press `F1` to brind up the command palette;
1. Select "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...".

This sets up an *entire* development environment, including a debugger, a linter and documentation. It may take a while to set up (~30 minutes) the first time.
